To keep homebrew reliably usable and ensure stable packages, there are some
(reasonable!) [criteria a formula must meet to be included in homebrew core](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae).

> ðŸ˜¬ <( Most of these projects fail one or both of the "be known" / "be used" tests. )

Projects which don't have broad enough usage to warrant inclusion in
homebrew-core are encouraged to maintain their own taps.

> :wave: This is the tap I maintain for my personal projects.

## Usage

```bash
brew tap andrew-canaday/tap
```

> :information_source: **NOTE**: _Re Bottles_:
>
> Formulas without a bottle must be installed from source, e.g.:
>
> ```bash
> brew install --build-from-source libbsat
> ```
